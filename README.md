## Emerald Isle Jewelry

Emerald Isle Jewelry is a fictional jewelry store specilaising in Irish made Celtic Jewelry. The sotre is built using Django, Python, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS and the sites main goal is to provde the user with an east to use interface where they can purchase and browse all items the online store has to offer. 

The idea for this project came from an online store I built myself and have since close before which sold Celtic Jewely.

The deployed site can be viewed here >>>>>

## UI/UX ##

The overall design is minimalistic and contemporary. High quality product images were used throughout os the overall theme was kep to a minimum as to not take away from those images. The overall layout is what you would espect from alot of E-commerce sites. A few products are dsplayed on the homepage along with some inviting links to encourage the user to delve deeper into the site.  

**Agile**

The agile approach was employed in designing and constructing this project, from the outset of planning to the completion of development. To facilitate the process, I established a GitHub project and adopted the Kanban board methodology to divide project components into user stories and feasible tasks.

For a comprehensive view of all user stories please refer to the linked project [Project Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/oconnorian3/projects/11/views/1). Additionally, each story has been assigned a label that indicates its level of significance in the site's overall functionality and acceptance.

**Strategy**

*Site Aims*

This is a fictional project but below are some aims if the site was to go into production.

Our aim is to celebrate and preserve the rich heritage of Celtic culture by offering a wide range of authentic Celtic jewelry designs inspired by traditional motifs and symbols. We strive to offer meticulously handcrafted Celtic jewelry pieces that showcase exceptional quality and attention to detail, ensuring that our customers receive timeless and durable pieces they can cherish for years to come. We strive to create a user-friendly and secure online platform that provides customers with a seamless shopping experience, offering detailed product information, multiple payment options, and prompt customer support.

The amount of products I could add is vast but due to time contraints and since this is a fictional project I will focus on they key items. Below are some core items this store would need to have. 

* Claddagh Rings
* Celtic Brooches
* Celtic Inpired Necklaces
* Celtic Inspired Earrings

The website caters to the following target groups:

 * User Roles:

    * Standard User
    * Account User
    * Administrator

 * Demographics

    * Mainly women with Irish Heritage
    * Main market will be the USA but Worldwide shipping will be an option

 * The website must provide the user with the ability to:

    * Browse and purchase products
    * Create an account 
    * Checkout as a guest user   
    * Fill out a contact form 

 * The website must provide the admin with the ability to:

    * Remove add and edit products 
    * Manage profiles  

    



*Opportunities*

*Scope*

In order to meet the project timeline and grading criteria, it is necessary to make trade-offs during the design and development process. To effectively manage this, I will employ the agile methodology. This involves conducting weekly progress reviews and making necessary adjustments to the features, whether by adding, adapting, or removing them, based on the project requirements. These reviews will be carried out after each sprint, ensuring that we deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by the specified deadline.

*Structure*

The site's layout is structured around ease of viewing products to make a seamless shopping experience and encourage sales. The home page has a large Shop Now button aswell as a featued Catergories and Product section. The nav bar also has a link to products aswell as various prompts/links throughout the site which will bring the user back to the producs page.

*Skeleton*

Wireframes were made using Lucid. Please click [here](https://github.com/oconnorian3/emerald-isle-jewelry/blob/main/README.md#Wireframe to view Wireframes.

*Surface*

This pertains to the visual design aspect and how to effectively convey the desired emotions and effects. For a more comprehensive understanding of planning for the surface plane please see below.

**Colour Scheme**

A light green background (#ebf3eb) for all pages was chosen throughout the site. This fitted in well with the overall theme of the site while also remaining light enough to allow images and other features and links throughout the site standout.

The colour (#494932) was used for the footer and various button and links throughout. This colour stands out and ties in well against the light green background while not been to harsh.
